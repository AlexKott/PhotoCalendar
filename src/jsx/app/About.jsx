            <p>We're Alex and Alina. If you didn't know that already you probably went wrong somewhere in the world wide web and there's a nice little button up left in your browser that will help you find your way back.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, you're very welcome!</p>
            <p>On this page you will find all there is to know about our travel-the-world-remote-working-adventure: pictures, plans (as far as we have any) and stories. If you have travel plans yourself and would like to meet us somewhere, please let us know!</p>
            <p>Also, if you find pictures of yourself that you would like us to remove you may hand in a formal complaint in quadruplicate that we will gladly review as fast as we can. You know, within the following six months or so. And know this: We love you, no matter how stupid you look in a picture. That's why you're on here.</p>
